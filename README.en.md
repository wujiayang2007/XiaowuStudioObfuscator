## About XiaowuStudioObfuscator

Original intention of XiaowuStudioObfuscator development:
In order to protect the fruits of developers' hard work, sweat and falling hair... It is an unshirkable responsibility to protect the code. In my opinion, it is very unfriendly to crack the software code. After all, there are many Net developers are scared by the words "cracking" and "piracy"! In order to protect the intellectual property rights of software developers, I have XiaowuStudioObfuscator. I hope this software can protect your Net software.
